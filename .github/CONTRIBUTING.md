# Contributing

Thanks for your interest but we don't accept pull requests. Any pull requests will be automatically closed.

To report a bug, request a feature, or share feedback, create a post in the [Shopify dev community forums](https://community.shopify.dev/c/shopify-cli-libraries/14)

## How to post in the forums

When you start a topic, include:

- The package you are using
- A clear summary of the problem, feature request, or feedback
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable), expected behavior, and actual behavior
- Relevant environment details (for example: API version, app type, browser, operating system)
- Screenshots or code snippets, if they help explain the issue

We monitor the forums and use them to triage, prioritize, and discuss work. Posts there reach the right people faster, and keep the conversation in one place.
